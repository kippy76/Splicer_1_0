Splicer 1.0

Splicer is a short game of six test levels developed for the Windows desktop. It was developed for the iGEM 2012 competition (see http://cwalker.me.uk/Software). The premise is simple - from a selection of Biobricks, you are tasked with the creation of biological solutions to given problems. By selecting each Biobrick, you insert it into the plasmid in the centre. Once you think you have a viable solution, you click on the 'Transcribe & Translate' button to see if you were right. If you are comfortable with C#, the full source code is included so that you may add more Biobricks and more levels.

The game was developed in Visual Studio using the XNA libraries
